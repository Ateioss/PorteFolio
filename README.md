# PorteFolio
My first portfolio


So what i have done today :
i have used vercel for deploy my portfolio and to install it. 
To do this i needed to create an index file in my main branch then after that i created a new versel project in which i have imported my github repository.
After having define the name of the project and some parameters( projectname "portfolio", the framework preset: other and i have desactived the others parameters)

After, every commit due to checkly installed in vercel allow to automaticly deploy the commit (updates of my site) in github
